React Native

What is it?
	- React is platform agnostic.  
	- React is a javascript library used for building user interfaces
	- When we use React for web development, we use ReactDOM.  React DOM knows how to take your React stuff and render it to the browser
	- React Native is like ReactDOM except it is for native mobile apps
	- React Native provides a collection of special components that are used for mobile development
	- Once compiled, it will be come a real native mobile app that you can deploy to Androis and iOS
	- Views are compiled into real native elements
	- Your business logic will not be compiled
	- The React Native components will be compiled into native elements
	- The business logic, http requests, etc are run on a separate thread within your app that is running a Javascript virtual machine

How do we get started?
	- Expo CLI = third party service which is completely free
	- It gives you a managed app development workflow
	- The downside is that you are locked into the expo workflow and all of the limitations that come with expo
	- It will extract away some of the complexities of building a native app which can help make development easier

	- React Native CLI = managed by the react native team and community
	- Bare bones development
	- It can be more cumbersome because there are almost no convenience or utility features
	- Full flexibility which will allow you to write native code for app development (android or iOS)
	- If you're using native features, you may have to import features and packages to make things work.

	- If you're justing getting started, the expo CLI will probably be your best bet because you don't need to know so much about native things.
	- You can install the expo client on your device which will allow you to test your app and see how it will work on a native device.
	- You can publish your app to the expo client so other people that have the expo client can use your app
	- Using expo, you can publish your app to the app store or play store so that people don't have to have the expo client to use your app

Getting started with Expo
	- Go to https://expo.io and click getting started
	- You need node.js as a dependency
	- You can install the expo cli by running npm install expo-cli --global
	- This will install the expo-cli globally on your machine so you can create apps easily.
	- Once installed, you can create a new expo-cli app by running expo init my-project-name
	- When prompted for a template, do not choose bare minimum as that will not install the convenience things from expo-cli

	- Once you have an app and have run npm start, you can open it using expo on your native device (an app you get from app/play store) and can scan the QR code that is in the terminal.
	- Expo will  then compile / bundle your javascript and display your app on your native device.
